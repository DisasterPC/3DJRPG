A little JRPG demo
December 11th 2021

## Controls
WASD to move in the first part
ESC to quit
Mouse for Camera movement.

## Implementation
A small area with a background, rain particles, music, ambience, animated models, Battle System (?), Dialouge, Character portraits, A Gun.

## References
Mixit for Rain Ambience
Mixit for Main Area Theme ("Cyberpunk City")
Mixit for Battle Theme ("Rought and Ready")
Mixit for Ending Theme ("echoes")

## Future Development
Maybe an actual battle system using turn orders lol.

## Known Bugs
Occasionally the camera will be inverted on launch, just press ESC and relaunch to get around this for the time being.
